This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in Python3.

## About

I use this repository to track my progress, document my approach to algorithmic problems, and share my solutions with the community. Each solution includes the problem description, my approach, and the actual code implementation.
Structure

Solutions are organized by problem number and name:

```
/problem_number_problem_name/
  - solution.py
  - README.md (contains problem description and approach)
```

## Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Build a reference collection of algorithm implementations
